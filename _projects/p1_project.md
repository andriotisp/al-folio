[Project Website](http://www.fortoo.eu/) <br>

Funded by the "EU Prevention of and Fight against Crime Programme "Illegal Use of Internet" - ISEC 2010 Action Grants, grant ref. HOME/2010/ISEC/AG/INT-002."<br>

"The project aims to develop digital forensics tools that will: (i) identify, (ii) analyze and (iii) visualize illegal activities on the Internet. The objectives of this project are: (i) to design and prototype a toolkit that will detect illegal activities both proactively and after-the-fact, (ii) to identify the source and perpetrators of the illegal activities, both in terms of virtual/network and, as much as possible, physical location, (iii) to profile the expertise and motive of the attackers, (iv) to present the relevant information in a way that will be usable by investigating authorities, and (v) to maximize the impact of the project through aggressive and effective dissemination of the project's results." *http://www.fortoo.eu/*
