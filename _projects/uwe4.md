* Details:
Japan Society for the Promotion of Science-日本学術振興会, <br>
JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship for Research in Japan, <br>
JSPS/OF199, "Malicious entity detection using fine-grained DNA-inspired behavioural modelling". <br>
Funding: JPY4,75M (approx. £35,000) (PI). <br>

*The aim of the project is to determine whether we can efficiently model an entity’s behaviour in digital environments using a high-level, finer-grained, DNA-inspired activity fingerprinting methodology with the intention to identify if this is a malicious or benign instance.*
